Try several sort of pipes in the OpenBSD kernel and test wether
they are suited for bidirectional throughput.  Two processes are
forked, which read and write into the pipe simultanously.  They
create checksums of the read and written data.  The Makefile checks
that each checksum and length appears twice.

At the moment these test cases have been implemented:
- socketpair with stream socketpair(2)
- pipe created with pipe(2)
- fifo named pipe with mkfifo(2)
- unix connects two local domain stream sockets
- pty creates two pseudo-tty with openpty(3)

Fifo does not support bidrectional communication, so it is disabled.
Pty creates two pseudo terminals, a third process exchanges all
data between the master device file descriptors.
