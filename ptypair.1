The

utility creates two pseudo terminal devices.
All data is copied bidirectionally between them.
The program terminates if standard input is closed or if both ptys
are closed.

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl q
Quiet mode, do not print pty name and number of transferred bytes.
.It Fl v

master pty.
.El

.Pa /dev/ttyp?
pseudo terminal device
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnostic messages are written to standard output.
The name of both pseudo terminals is prefixed with
.Li PTY: .
Data read from a master pty is prefixed with
.Li >>>
and data written with
.Li <<< .
After all transfer has finished successfully, the number of bytes
is logged as
.Li READLEN:
and
.Li WRITELEN: .
To identify the pty, the master file descriptor is always logged
into the first column.
